D3 Visualization of Chicago Airbnb price distribution per neighborhood 

## Used Sources for Implementation

When implementing the visualization, I mainly focused on following the structure of the solution to the d3 tutorial for the bar chart with interaction, provided by the lecture team. For this reason, all references mentioned in the solution file of the tutorial are also used here, implicitly.

Furthermore, for implementing the Select Button (dropdown), I used the extern reference https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_select.html.

Since I had no experience with d3 before attending this course, I watched the youtube course mentioned in the Tuwel course as an introduction to d3. Then, I tried to solve the tutorial files provided by the lecture team and then I started with implementing the visualization.

During the implementation, I used Generative AI (chatgpt, gemini) for code generation, code explanation and debugging. I tried to use the tools for generating simple implementations - such as plotting without the dropdown option - and then extend these implementations. I also used the mentioned AI tools to adjust the html and css files.
